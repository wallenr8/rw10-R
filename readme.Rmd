Body Mass Index (BMI) is a personâ€™s weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

personal trainers are often using your bmi and other tools to conduct and oproperly train clients. this tool can help with recommendations for Diet. 

Cardiac output is the flow rate of the heart. It tells how much blood the heart pumps in a minute.

This stroke volume calculator will help you determine the amount of blood that is pumped by your heart in a single beat. This value is often used in anesthesiology to measure the recovery after anesthesia. 

issue: I hads issues with  the values, coming out as negative values, i had to use absolute value for outputs. entries are manually inputted.

calculator takes w1, w2, w3,w4, w5, w6, h

output = returns data visualuztion of your weight over last six months, dietary recommendations 

blood pressure calculator takes blood pressure reading systilic and diastolic and returns cardiac output and pulse pressure
